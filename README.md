# SkyDiving

## A Unity3D Virtual Reality application done for Virtual Reality class in Spring of 2018.

The goal of the application was to provide a semi-realistic experience for Skydiving. During the trial, a fan was set up to simulate the air rushing past you while falling through the sky.

The controls for the parachute were based on the controllers' positions rather than any button combination.

## The original README for the project to suit the needs of the assignment is as follows:

SKYDIVING SIMULATOR

We chose B for our project--the Immersion Experience.

I've left the fan in the lab--to get the most out of the experience, turn the fan on high.
	*It's worth noting that this fan is from the 1930s--be very careful with it, as it was
	a gift from my mom to me!
	*More importantly be VERY careful with yourself around it! The guard
	surrounding the blades will not stop your fingers and arms from getting cut by the blades
	if you get near it!
	*One more time, MAKE SURE ANYONE WHO TRIES THIS SIMULATION IS CAUTIOUS NOT TO GET TOO
	CLOSE!!! This is the only fan I have, so I couldn't elect for a safer one!
	

The steps for running the simulation are as follow:

1) Start the simulation and stand facing the fan where you can feel the breeze.

2) Once you've looked around the helicopter, to jump you press either pad on the vive controller.

3) As you fall, your view turns 90 degrees to the side to simulate you falling face first.
	*Feel the breeze, watch the clouds go by, watch the tiny landmass slowly grow larger.
	*There is no steering implemented here, as you're free-falling. You can walk around and it's
	as though you're falling with your back down, your side down, and your face first, however!

4) Once you've fallen long enough, press either of the triggers to deploy your parachute.
	*I would recommend pulling your parachute open roughly when you've passed the cloud layer.

5) You steer your parachute with the direction the vive HMD is facing.
	*Additional steering is provided by simulating parachute cords that can be pulled on.
		-If you lift one vive controller and pull down the other your view will rotate,
		allowing you to have a more precise steering.
		-This lifting and pulling down works in either direction.

6) Try to land on the island! The further up you deploy your parachute the harder it is, but also the
longer the experience is!

7) Once on the ground, you can explore by using steering with the HMD still. To move forward, simply
click the pad on the vive controller and you will walk forward. There isn't a lot to explore on the
tiny island, but there is a treasure chest!

A FINAL NOTE:
You may have noticed the white capsule falling with you. I considered getting rid of it or making it
much smaller, however, it serves two main purposes. One is that it holds the scripts! The other is
that as you're falling through the sky, when you pull your parachute it gives you something in
the air falling with you that you can steer towards. You can land on the island by making sure to
line yourself up with the capsule as it falls.
