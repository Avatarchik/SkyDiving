# SkyDiving

## A Unity3D Virtual Reality application done for Virtual Reality class in Spring of 2018.

The goal of the application was to provide a semi-realistic experience for Skydiving. During the trial, a fan was set up to simulate the air rushing past you while falling through the sky.

The controls for the parachute were based on the controllers' positions rather than any button combination.
